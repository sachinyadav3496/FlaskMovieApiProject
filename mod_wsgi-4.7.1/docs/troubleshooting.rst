Troubleshooting
===============

If you are having problems getting mod_wsgi to start up or do what you want
it to do, first off ensure that you read the following documents:

* :doc:`user-guides/installation-issues`
* :doc:`user-guides/configuration-issues`
* :doc:`user-guides/application-issues`

You can also do some basic checking of your installation and configuration
to validate that how it is setup is how you expect it to be. See the
following document:

* :doc:`user-guides/checking-your-installation`

If none of the common issues match up with the problem you are seeing and
are after other ideas, or you have the need to perform more low level
debugging, check out the :doc:`user-guides`.
