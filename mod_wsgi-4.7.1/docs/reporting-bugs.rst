Reporting Bugs
==============

If you believe you have uncovered a bug in mod_wsgi code then lodge a bug
report on the mod_wsgi issue tracker. The issue tracker is located on
GitHub at:

* https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/issues
 
Before creating a ticket on the issue tracker, please do try and ensure you
attempt to resolve issues using the mod_wsgi mailing list first as
explained in :doc:`finding-help`. The majority of issues lodged via the
issue tracker are not actually bugs in mod_wsgi but due to external factors
or simply a failure to read the documentation.
